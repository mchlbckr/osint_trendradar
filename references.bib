  abstract = {Technical developments in computer hardware and software now make it possible to introduce automation into virtually all aspects of human-machine systems. Given these technical capabilities, which system functions should be automated and to what extent? We outline a model for types and levels of automation that provides a framework and an objective basis for making such choices. Appropriate selection is important because automation does not merely supplant but changes human activity and can impose new coordination demands on the human operator. We propose that automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model. Secondary evaluative criteria include automation reliability and the costs of decision/action consequences, among others. Examples of recommended types and levels of automation are provided to illustrate the application of the model to automation design.},

We propose the deep learning algorithm to extract entities and relationship from open-source intelligence by the RoBERTa-wwm-ext pretraining model and a knowledge fusion framework based on the longest common attribute entity alignment technology and bring in different text similarity algorithms and classification algorithms for verification. The experimental research showed that the named entity recognition model using the RoBERTa-wwm-ext pretrained model achieves the best results in terms of recall rate and F1 value, first, and the F value of RoBERTa-wwm-ext + BiLSTM + CRF reached up to 83.07{\%}. Second, the RoBERTa-wwm-ext relationship extraction model has achieved the best results; compared with the relation extraction model based on recurrent neural network, it is improved by about 20{\%}$\sim$30{\%}. Finally, the entity alignment algorithm based on the attribute similarity of the longest common subsequence has achieved the best results on the whole. The findings of this study provide an effective way to complete knowledge graph construction in domain-specific texts. The research serves as a first step for future research, for example, domain-specific intelligent Q{\&}A.},

It is one of today's most rapidly growing technical fields, lying at the intersection of computer science and statistics, and at the core of artificial intelligence and data science. Recent progress in machine learning has been driven both by the development of new learning algorithms and theory and by the ongoing explosion in the availability of online data and low-cost computation. The adoption of data-intensive machine-learning methods can be found throughout science, technology and commerce, leading to more evidence-based decision-making across many walks of life, including health care, manufacturing, education, financial modeling, policing, and marketing.},

@article{Huang.2021,
  abstract = {Cyber threats are one of the most pressing issues in the digital age. There has been a consensus on deploying a proactive defense to effectively detect and respond to adversary threats. The key to success is understanding the characteristics of malware, including their activities and manipulated resources on the target machines. The MITRE ATT{\&}CK framework (ATT{\&}CK), a popular source of open source intelligence (OSINT), provides rich information and knowledge about adversary lifecycles and attack behaviors. The main challenges of this study involve knowledge collection from ATT{\&}CK, malicious behavior identification using deep learning, and the identification of associated API calls. A MITRE ATT{\&}CK based Malicious Behavior Analysis system (MAMBA) for Windows malware is proposed, which incorporates ATT{\&}CK knowledge and considers attentions on manipulated resources and malicious activities in the neural network model. To synchronize ATT{\&}CK updates in a timely manner, knowledge collection can be an automatic and incremental process. Given these features, MAMBA achieves the best performance of malicious behavior discovery among all the compared learning-based methods and rule-based approaches on all datasets; it also yields a highly interpretable mapping from the discovered malicious behaviors to relevant ATT{\&}CK techniques, as well as to the related API calls.},

@article{Stoltzfus.2011,
  abstract = {Regression techniques are versatile in their application to medical research because they can measure associations, predict outcomes, and control for confounding variable effects. As one such technique, logistic regression is an efficient and powerful way to analyze the effect of a group of independent variables on a binary outcome by quantifying each independent variable's unique contribution. Using components of linear regression reflected in the logit scale, logistic regression iteratively identifies the strongest linear combination of variables with the greatest probability of detecting the observed outcome. Important considerations when conducting logistic regression include selecting independent variables, ensuring that relevant assumptions are met, and choosing an appropriate model building strategy. For independent variable selection, one should be guided by such factors as accepted theory, previous empirical investigations, clinical considerations, and univariate statistical analyses, with acknowledgement of potential confounding variables that should be accounted for. Basic assumptions that must be met for logistic regression include independence of errors, linearity in the logit for continuous variables, absence of multicollinearity, and lack of strongly influential outliers. Additionally, there should be an adequate number of events per independent variable to avoid an overfit model, with commonly recommended minimum {\textquotedbl}rules of thumb{\textquotedbl} ranging from 10 to 20 events per covariate. Regarding model building strategies, the three general types are direct/standard, sequential/hierarchical, and stepwise/statistical, with each having a different emphasis and purpose. Before reaching definitive conclusions from the results of any of these methods, one should formally quantify the model's internal validity (i.e., replicability within the same data set) and external validity (i.e., generalizability beyond the current sample). The resulting logistic regression model's overall fit to the sample data is assessed using various goodness-of-fit measures, with better fit characterized by a smaller difference between observed and model-predicted values. Use of diagnostic statistics is also recommended to further assess the adequacy of the model. Finally, results for independent variables are typically reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs).},

  abstract = {Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.},

Zur Aufkl{\"a}rung dieser Straftaten kommt aus technischer Perspektive die Nutzung von Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) in Betracht. Diese Methode bezeichnet einen Vorgang, bei dem Daten aus {\"o}ffentlich zug{\"a}nglichen Quellen gesammelt werden, um durch deren Auswertung an ermittlungsrelevante Erkenntnisse zu gelangen. Der folgende Beitrag thematisiert die Nutzung von OSINT zur Strafverfolgung im Darknet und wirft die Frage auf, was nach dem aktuellen Stand der Technik m{\"o}glich und was auf Grundlage der geltenden strafprozessualen Vorgaben rechtlich zul{\"a}ssig ist. Die Verfasser*innen kommen zu dem Ergebnis, dass ein legislatives {\glqq}Update{\grqq} der StPO unvermeidbar sein wird, wenn die rechtlichen Vorgaben mit den technischen M{\"o}glichkeiten Schritt halten sollen. Dieses Ergebnis wird damit begr{\"u}ndet, dass die Nutzung von OSINT aufgrund ihrer grundrechtlichen Eingriffsintensit{\"a}t in vielen F{\"a}llen nicht mehr auf die Ermittlungsgeneralklausel der {\S}{\S} 161, 163 StPO gest{\"u}tzt werden kann.},

Startups don't fail because of bad execution, or missed deadlines, or blown budgets. They fail because they are building something nobody wants. Whether they arise from someone's garage or are created within a mature Fortune 500 organization, new ventures, by definition, are designed to create new products or services under conditions of extreme uncertainly. Their primary mission is to find out what customers ultimately will buy. One of the central premises of The Lean Startup movement is what Ries calls {\textquotedbl}validated learning{\textquotedbl} about the customer. It is a way of getting continuous feedback from customers so that the company can shift directions or alter its plans inch by inch, minute by minute.

Surpassing humans would mean replicating, reaching and exceeding key distinctive properties of human beings, for example, high-level cognition associated with conscious perception. However, can computers be compared with humans? Can computers become conscious? Can computers outstrip human capabilities? These are paradoxical and controversial questions, particularly because there are many hidden assumptions and misconceptions about the understanding of the brain. In this sense, it is necessary to first explore these assumptions and then suggest how the specific information processing of brains would be replicated by machines. Therefore, this article will discuss a subset of human capabilities and the connection with conscious behavior, secondly, a prototype theory of consciousness will be explored and machines will be classified according to this framework. Finally, this analysis will show the paradoxical conclusion that trying to achieve conscious machines to beat humans implies that computers will never completely exceed human capabilities, or if the computer were to do it, the machine should not be considered a computer anymore.},

@article{Fang.2020,
  abstract = {In recent years, the number of vulnerabilities discovered and publicly disclosed has shown a sharp upward trend. However, the value of exploitation of vulnerabilities varies for attackers, considering that only a small fraction of vulnerabilities are exploited. Therefore, the realization of quick exclusion of the non-exploitable vulnerabilities and optimal patch prioritization on limited resources has become imperative for organizations. Recent works using machine learning techniques predict exploited vulnerabilities by extracting features from open-source intelligence (OSINT). However, in the face of explosive growth of vulnerability information, there is room for improvement in the application of past methods to multiple threat intelligence. A more general method is needed to deal with various threat intelligence sources. Moreover, in previous methods, traditional text processing methods were used to deal with vulnerability related descriptions, which only grasped the static statistical characteristics but ignored the context and the meaning of the words of the text. To address these challenges, we propose an exploit prediction model, which is based on a combination of fastText and LightGBM algorithm and called fastEmbed. We replicate key portions of the state-of-the-art work of exploit prediction and use them as benchmark models. Our model outperforms the baseline model whether in terms of the generalization ability or the prediction ability without temporal intermixing with an average overall improvement of 6.283{\%} by learning the embedding of vulnerability-related text on extremely imbalanced data sets. Besides, in terms of predicting the exploits in the wild, our model also outperforms the baseline model with an F1 measure of 0.586 on the minority class (33.577{\%} improvement over the work using features from darkweb/deepweb). The results demonstrate that the model can improve the ability to describe the exploitability of vulnerabilities and predict exploits in the wild effectively.},

@article{Endsley.1999,
  abstract = {Various levels of automation (LOA) designating the degree of human operator and computer control were explored within the context of a dynamic control task as a means of improving overall human/machine performance. Automated systems have traditionally been explored as binary function allocations; either the human or the machine is assigned to a given task. More recently, intermediary levels of automation have been discussed as a means of maintaining operator involvement in system performance, leading to improvements in situation awareness and reductions in out-of-the-loop performance problems. A LOA taxonomy applicable to a wide range of psychomotor and cognitive tasks is presented here. The taxonomy comprises various schemes of generic control system function allocations. The functions allocated to a human operator and/or computer included monitoring displays, generating processing options, selecting an 'optimal' option and implementing that option. The impact of the LOA taxonomy was assessed within a dynamic and complex cognitive control task by measuring its effect on human/system performance, situation awareness and workload. Thirty subjects performed simulation trials involving various levels of automation. Several automation failures occurred and out-of-the-loop performance decrements were assessed. Results suggest that, in terms of performance, human operators benefit most from automation of the implementation portion of the task, but only under normal operating conditions; in contrast, removal of the operator from task implementation is detrimental to performance recovery if the automated system fails. Joint human/system option generation significantly degraded performance in comparison to human or automated option generation alone. Lower operator workload and higher situation awareness were observed under automation of the decision making portion of the task (i.e. selection of options), although human/system performance was only slightly improved. The implications of these findings for the design of automated systems are discussed.},

The methodology provides a valuable means of continuous feedback on perceived risk of the site. A semantic analysis on Twitter text messages provided input to the risk management team with which they could respond immediately mitigating any apparent risk and reducing the perceived risk. A two-stage approach was adopted to prune a massively large dataset from Twitter. In the first phase, a social network analysis and visualisation tool NodeXL was used to determine the most recurrent words, which was achieved using polarity. This resulted in a suitable subset. In the second phase, the subset was subjected to sentiment and emotion mapping by survey participants. This led to a hybrid approach of using automation for pruning datasets from social media and using a human approach to sentiment and emotion analysis. Whilst suffering from COVID-19, equally, people suffered due to loneliness from isolation dictated by the World Health Organisation. The work revealed that despite such conditions, people's sentiments demonstrated a positive effect from the online discussions on the Herculaneum site.},

  abstract = {Today, open source intelligence (OSINT), i.e., information derived from publicly available sources, makes up between 80 and 90 percent of all intelligence activities carried out by Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and intelligence services in the West. Developments in data mining, machine learning, visual forensics and, most importantly, the growing computing power available for commercial use, have enabled OSINT practitioners to speed up, and sometimes even automate, intelligence collection and analysis, obtaining more accurate results more quickly. As the infosphere expands to accommodate ever-increasing online presence, so does the pool of actionable OSINT. These developments raise important concerns in terms of governance, ethical, legal, and social implications (GELSI). New and crucial oversight concerns emerge alongside standard privacy concerns, as some of the more advanced data analysis tools require little to no supervision. This article offers a systematic review of the relevant literature. It analyzes 571 publications to assess the current state of the literature on the use of AI-powered OSINT (and the development of OSINT software) as it relates to the GELSI framework, highlighting potential gaps and suggesting new research directions.},
